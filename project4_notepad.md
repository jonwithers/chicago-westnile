Perhaps we should train three models on three different sets of features and then ensemble them somehow?
This will require some method for ad hoc ensemble.  Perhaps one works on weather, one works on spraying, one works on trap data?

Work on each classifier in parallel until it is determined that a classifier is complete, or should be abandoned or sgoudl be combined with another classifier, etc., then re-allocate staff.

#### Pseudocode

Put all data into a dataframe or dataframes
  Clean
  
EDA
  Get basic stats, whatever you like
  Build a baseline model and run it

Build trap classifier


Build weather classifier


Build spray classifier


Build the ensembe classifier
